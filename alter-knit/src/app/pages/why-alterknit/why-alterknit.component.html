                        uses yarn from the original garment to REKNIT the damaged area matching the pattern and style.
                        The work is done by hand and most times under a magnifying glass to make sure that it’s done
                        just right.</div>

                        known as FRENCH REWEAVING, where the damaged area is rewoven. For larger damage on suits, a
                        piece of
                        fabric is taken from an unnoticeable area of the garment and is inlaid, matching the pattern of
                        the
                        garment exactly. In some cases, a faint outline might show.
